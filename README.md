# eXtra-fast Essential Video Decoder (XEVD)  

[![Build](https://github.com/mpeg5/xevd/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mpeg5/xevd/actions/workflows/build.yml)  

The **eXtra-fast Essential Video Decoder** (XEVD) is an opensource and fast MPEG-5 EVC decoder. 

**MPEG-5 Essential Video Coding** (EVC) is a video compression standard of ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). The main goal of the EVC is to provide a significantly improved compression capability over existing video coding standards with timely publication of terms. 
The EVC defines two profiles, including "**Baseline Profile**" and "**Main Profile**". The "Baseline profile" contains only technologies that are older than 20 years or otherwise freely available for use in the standard. In addition, the "Main profile" adds a small number of additional tools, each of which can be either cleanly disabled or switched to the corresponding baseline tool on an individual basis.
