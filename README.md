# eXtra-fast Essential Video Decoder (XEVD)

[![Build](https://github.com/mpeg5/xevd/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mpeg5/xevd/actions/workflows/build.yml)

The **eXtra-fast Essential Video Decoder** (XEVD) is an opensource and fast MPEG-5 EVC decoder.

**MPEG-5 Essential Video Coding** (EVC) is a video compression standard of ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). The main goal of the EVC is to provide a significantly improved compression capability over existing video coding standards with timely publication of terms.
The EVC defines two profiles, including "**Baseline Profile**" and "**Main Profile**". The "Baseline profile" contains only technologies that are older than 20 years or otherwise freely available for use in the standard. In addition, the "Main profile" adds a small number of additional tools, each of which can be either cleanly disabled or switched to the corresponding baseline tool on an individual basis.

  - Output
    - Base DEB package for **Baseline Profile**:
      - package: xevd-base-dev_1.0.0_amd64.deb
      - checksum file: xevd-base-dev_1.0.0_amd64.deb.md5
    - Developer DEB package for **Baseline Profile**::
      - package: xevd-base_1.0.0_amd64.deb
      - checksum file: xevd-base_1.0.0_amd64.deb.md5 generated.
    - Base DEB package for **Main Profile**:
      - package: xevd-main-dev_1.0.0_amd64.deb
      - checksum file: xevd-main-dev_1.0.0_amd64.deb.md5

     ```

### Windows (64-bit)
- Requirements
  - NSIS 3.08 or later (download from [https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download))

- Generation of **NSIS windows installer** instructions
  - Follow build instruction and build the project
  - Generate **NSIS Windows installer**
    - Command Prompt for Visual Studio
      - Go to the build directory and issue the following command
      ```
      msbuild /P:Configuration=Release PACKAGE.vcxproj
      ```

    - Visual Studio IDE
      - Open up the generated solution (XEVD.sln)
      - Change build type from Debug to Release
      - Go to the Solution Explorer, then select and mouse right click on the PACKAGE project located in CMakePredefinedTargets folder
      - Choose Build item, when a pop down menu appears

      > As a result CPack processing message should appear and NSIS installer as well as as checksum file are generated into build directory.

    - MinGW-64
      - Go to the build directory and issue the following command
      ```
      $make package
      ```
  - Output:
    - Baseline Profile:
      - xevd-base-1.0.0-win64.exe
      - xevd-base-1.0.0-win64.exe.md5

    - Main Profile:
        - xevd-main-1.0.0-win64.exe
        - xevd-main-1.0.0-win64.exe.md5
## How to use
XEVD supports main and baseline profiles of EVC.
